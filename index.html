                <h1>Preposition Basics</h1>
                <p>A preposition is a word or group of words used before a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase to show
                    direction, time, place, location, spatial relationships, or to introduce an object. Some examples of
                    prepositions are words like "in," "at," "on," "of," and "to."</p>
                <p>
                    Prepositions in English are highly idiomatic. Although there are some rules for usage, much
                    preposition usage is dictated by fixed expressions. In these cases, it is best to memorize the
                    phrase instead of the individual preposition.
                </p>

                <h1>Prepositions Following Verbs and Adjectives</h1>
                <p>Some verbs and adjectives are followed by a certain preposition. Sometimes verbs and adjectives can
                    be followed by different prepositions, giving the phrase different meanings. To find which
                    prepositions follow the verb or an adjective, look up the verb or adjective in an online dictionary,
                    such as Merriam Webster, or use a corpus, such as The Corpus of Contemporary American English.
                    Memorizing these phrases instead of just the preposition alone is the most helpful.</p>

                <p><b>With:</b> (dis)agree, argue, deal</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Although verb + preposition combinations appear similar to phrasal verbs, the verb and the particle
                    (in this case, the preposition) in these combinations cannot be separated like phrasal verbs.</p>
